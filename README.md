# Early Detection of Cervical Cancer using Machine Learning Classifiers for Improved Diagnosis in Underserved Regions
## About the Project
This project aims to predict the risk of cervical cancer using various machine learning models. The dataset includes features like age, number of pregnancies, smoking habits, and STD history. Techniques such as feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, and ensemble learning are applied to enhance the model's performance.

## Modules Used:
  1. pandas - Data handling and preprocessing.
  2. sklearn - Machine learning models and metrics.
  3. numpy - Numerical computations.
  4. matplotlib, seaborn - Visualization tools.
     
## Techniques Used:
  1. Feature Selection: Identifying the most relevant features for improved model accuracy.
  2. Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters for better results.
  3. Ensemble Methods: Combining multiple models to improve overall accuracy:
     - Bagging
     - Boosting (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting)

## Accuracy of the Model
  Decision tree after sampling provides the highest accuracy as 95.2%
